# Server away
# nobody actually asked for this but i decided to let you have it anyway. If
# you enable this option, the script will send AWAY messages to the server which
# show up in a WHOIS or when someone PMs you (the server sends these back to
# a client PMing you whenever they send a PM line. this will piss whoever's
# pming you off unless their client allows them to hide people's AWAY
# announcements as xchat does)

# below). Set blank to disable. IF YOU ENABLE SERVER AWAY MESSAGES, THIS WILL
# BE DISABLED AND USED AS YOUR SERVER AWAY MESSAGE.

# The amount of time for a nickname in the PM cache to die. Nicks in this
# cache will not be sent your pm away message. They are added to the cache
# or updated whenever they PM you. The time is in minutes. This usually means
# they will only see your away notice ONCE unless they pause for longer than
# this period.

# Backtick protection -- If this is set to 1 or yes, and the script has
# detected your 'original' nick on a certain server and that nick contains a
# backtick, the script will assume that it has detected a residue away nick
# (instead of your REAL 'original' nick) and will use the default primary
# nickname as your 'original' nick. (your 'original' nick is the one that
# /back renames you to)

awaymask	= /me is away: %r (gone at %D%e %T, %H:%M:%S)

reasonmask	= /me changes away reason from "%o" to "%r"

# The mask modifiers:

# The % items in reasonlistitem, awaymask, backmask etc are modifers which
# are replaced by the script with meaningful values.

# Here are the modifiers specific to awaymask, backmask and reasonmask.
#
# NOTE: These are done sequentially in the order shown here. This means that
# you can write %t in your away message and it will be replaced with the time
# you've been away for, since the reason is replaced BEFORE the time string.
#
# %l	Reason list (see below for modifiers for each item in the reasonlist)
# %r	The away reason
# %o	The previous away reason (if there is one)
# %t	A dynamic time string (e.g. 1w 2d 3h 40m 24s). This string lengthens
#		as the away time increases; for example if you'd only been away 40 mins
#		it would read "40m 0s" (total away time) (total)

# %Y	The year at which you left (e.g. "2002")
# %y	The short year at which you left (e.g. "02")
# %e	The end of the month day number, (e.g. "st" "nd" "rd" "th")

# %q	A dynamic time string as %t above, but relates to the time since the
#		last reason change, NOT the total away time.
# %a	Hours since last reason change
# %b	Minutes since last reason change
# %c	Seconds since last reason change
# %f	Days since last reason change
# %g	Weeks since last reason change
# %A	Hour of last reason change (GMT - 24 hour clock)

# %L	The end of the month day number for last reason change (e.g. "st", "nd"
#		etc)

# Here are those available to reasonlistitem (not all the above are available):
# %r	The away reason
